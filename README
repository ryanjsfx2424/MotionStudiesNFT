For Heroku, note I'm using Python 3.9.1
=======
Note, we're currently Infura API limited (1e5 calls free per day).
Given that backend.py in the while true does 3*maxSupply calls,
I should sleep about a minute to barely not exceed the API limit.

But since I'll want to use the INFURA API for other projects,
maybe more like 5 minutes.

Also since I didn't catch this, for today I'll have to degrade
to once per 10 minutes (already at 75% used).
===
Other limitations:

Heroku, only free ~20 days per month (31/31 if credit card added,
think only for one app tho).

Google Cloud: free for another 50ish days (today is 2022-03-27).
Then I think it's like $1 per month or something pretty cheap given
our present utilization.
